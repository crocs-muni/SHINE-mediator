# SHINE-mediator

`mediator` is a Rust implementation of a service that mediates communication among clients running different multi-party Schnorr signature protocol implementations. `mediator` can interact with smartcards running SHINE applet via PC/SC interface and contains internal implementations of other multi-party Schnorr signature protocols.

## Supported protocols

Currently, `mediator` supports distributed key generation with commitment and multiple approaches to Schnorr signing.

### Key Generation

- KeygenCommit (smartcard, simulated)

### Schnorr Signing

- NonceExchange (smartcard, simulated)
- NonceCommit (simulated, interoperable with NonceExchange)
- NonceDelin (simulated, interoperable with NonceExchange)

## Usage

Clone the repository and run `cargo run -- --test` (requires Rust compiler) which builds the project and runs `mediator` functionality tests.

To view detailed log info, set environment variable `RUST_LOG=info`.

```bash
â†ª RUST_LOG=info cargo run -- --test

If simulated clients are sufficient, conditional compilation without PC/SC backend can be performed with `--no-default-features` option.
