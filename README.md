# MPCD

`mpcd` is a Rust implementation of a service that intermediates communication among different clients running multiparty protocol implementations. `mpcd` can now interact with smartcards via PC/SC interface and contains internal implementations of several multiparty protocols.

## Supported protocols

Currently, `mpcd` supports distributed key generation and multiple approaches to Schnorr signing.

### Key Generation

- KeygenCommit (smartcard, simulated)

### Schnorr Signing

- NonceExchange (smartcard, simulated)
- NonceCommit (simulated, interoperable with NonceExchange)
- NonceDelin (simulated, interoperable with NonceExchange)

## Usage

Clone the repository and run `cargo run` (requires Rust compiler) which builds the project and runs the `mpcd` demonstration.

To view detailed log info, set environment variable `RUST_LOG=info`.

```bash

```

If simulated clients are sufficient, conditional compilation without PC/SC backend can be performed with `--no-default-features` option.
